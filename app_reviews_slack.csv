0,Literally impossible to log in You can only log in via Magic Links in which you must have access to the email on the same device I can not access my work email on an external device for security reasons and verifying my email on another device will still not allow my mobile device to sign in In response to developer comment: No there is no option to log in with email/password Clicking log in manually ONLY provides a field for Workspace URL which always fails and says not valid,0.006772046,0.00678288,0.006738881,0.979706193
1,Notifications are utterly terrible especially if youre ever using the app on more than one platform I understand that theyre trying to monitize but the history limit makes the usability of this for anything important a joke Speaking of money considering that you can get Teams for free what they want for paid accounts is ridiculous The app on most platforms has massive overhead and barely works how do you not have gif integration but you can completely redo the graphics every 3 months,0.007639521,0.007706204,0.976854072,0.007800204

12,Not suitable for Android users I cant even log in to Slack using this mobile app and have been trying for the past three months now to no avail Every time I try to log in I get taken to my phone settings with no instructional messages or prompts So I have no idea what Im supposed to be doing in my settings to get it to work Please do better If we sign in via desktop the mobile process should be seamlessbut it isntterrible,0.008716738,0.008556961,0.00878201,0.973944291
13,I have a real problem getting alerts on my phone with this app The alerts are on but sometimes I get them anywhere from a few hours late to a few days late then the alert doesnt always clear after viewing so it looks like I have alerts that I dont have This is problematic because I use this for work and its the primary way my work contacts me as we are decentralized Please help,0.010107855,0.010473335,0.009645581,0.969773228
14,This app is little more than a read/reply version of the desktop version There are no options for customization sorting deleting channels/threads etc Unread channels conveniently move to the top of the stack so you need to scroll all over the place to find a channel If I didnt need to stay connected to work conversations if delete immediately,0.533071491,0.447285787,0.009845607,0.009797114
15,This app has a good bit of features that are nice Like theme personalization and having a personal thread for quick notes It also syncs settings instantly between devices However its a battery hog when open and in the background Huddles are nearly useless on my Duo When I open a thread the prompt to join a huddle often crashes the whole app And when someone stops a screen share in a huddle it crashes Contacted support  Im not hopeful despite them being very kind,0.006783858,0.006838992,0.00667728,0.97969987
16,I feel like Android app recent update made organization of channels worse Just one flat group of everything  where are the custom sections and ways to organize In an enterprise with hundreds of channels its useless and almost impossible to find the channels I need to monitor,0.01164172,0.964956248,0.011932816,0.011469217
17,A mess Interface is not user friendly  everything is really confusing to get a handle of  and its so *buggy*  sign in not working  screens flashing  buttons not working  etc  to bosses and teachers everywhere: for the love of the people in your group  DONT USE THIS  just make a discord server or something  same thing but less buggy and A LOT easier to use  trust me  your group will thank you ,0.008407982,0.008533515,0.974386912,0.008671591
18,Galaxy S21 / Android 12  As others have reviewed the push notifications are essentially worthless Most often the push notifications are never delivered In those rare cases they are delivered its usually hours after the post to the Slack channel Email notifications are substantially more reliable but whats the point of having email notifications enabled when push notifications are enabled Until the push notifications are fixed the Slack apps best use is opening it up to send a message Just dont expect to get a reply via push notification ps Slack Robot no I will not send an email to feedback at Slack unless you want to put me on your payroll to help troubleshoot your app,0.985944701,0.004586144,0.004699433,0.004769722
19,Hmthis is the second time Im finding my review missing Anyway issue was resolved by using the option to signin manually the email link received worked and was able to sign in with android phone Dont use the other option (sending a magic link to your email) Signin manually with your email reset password and then a magic link will be sent to your email that actually works,0.006957545,0.006749664,0.006811828,0.979480963
20,My work uses Slack Im a software developer Slack stinks of bugs and lack of professionalism They change UI and features without concern for existing user productivity deprecate OS and browser versions on a whim etc 1 You can no longer delete zoom call msgs 2 On Android replies to a thread AND channel is now a multi step process 3 On Linux it insists opening its own browser process and reopen all my default tabs with it Etc Not enough room here to list all the faults,0.404383199,0.006988027,0.006682654,0.581946119
21,Black screens in every thread Pixel 6 pro and pixel 5 We just got stuck with this BS COVID19 hit and this was our best option Obviously the app was popular with devs because you can do cool things like alert you when a sale has been made and the documentation was great The pitfalls of slack are going to be the pitfalls of our society The app is mediocre regardless,0.010680946,0.9679822,0.010834603,0.010502251
22,This app has a lot of potential however its inconsistent and therefore problematic For example the status update sometimes fails to save despite user feedback that it does Often its also not possible to access and respond to messages that are in thread,0.436737933,0.013583672,0.013747853,0.535930543
23,The fact that I am forced to download the desktop version in order to make changes to the mobile version is absolutely ridiculous My notification setting is always changing itself to pause for seemingly no reason at all I constantly have to change it back to giving me notifications,0.011841476,0.838608048,0.012024717,0.137525759
24,Why you changed the left sidebar (list of channels and conversations) BG colors on mobile app Im having very different expirience on mobile than on desktop now hard to immediately understand what is going on if Im constantly switching between mobile and desktop slack apps This is very strange move It is not fixable by enabling the dark mode as I want to have the same set of colors on mobile app as on desktop app for the same app areas as on desktop while not in dark mode,0.378491075,0.396627815,0.006596874,0.218284236

27,UPDATE: very strange that i cannot edit my own review in here but i solved my issue After i made the Google account Default (the one i need to use to sign into Slack workspace) i logged out from all the workspaces deleted the cache reinstalled the app and it works now I was able to login into the workspace that i need to use I dont know if its a Google thing or Slack but this needs to be solved I shouldnt need to go through Security Settings in order just to login into a Slack,0.006274606,0.0062738,0.006198248,0.981253345

31,The copy link doesnt actually copy the link Most of the stuff people share on slack I want to either open on a different device or in Incognito so I need to be able to copy it from my Android Now I have to do copy text and delete whatever their commentary was on the link I wish that slack updates didnt break the app so often and I wish theyd fix it faster when things like this do happen Due to the amount of bugs they should really streamline reporting them too,0.006881735,0.465579268,0.007301747,0.52023725

43,Please use the update descriptions for actual information Edit: yes I mean the release notes What does this mean: What’s New • No news is good news Well some news can also be good news or no news could perhaps lead to uncertainty and speculation on par with bad news but in this case our absence of news is a good thing Or at least not a bad thing No news is just fine Carry on,0.008083113,0.008186984,0.008574804,0.975155098
44,Its okay However I frequently have new messages notifications but these messages do not show up in the app The app will highlight the channels with unread messages but visiting these channels only shows the old messages Nothing helps to solve the issue: killing the app restarting the phone clearing the cache The only way is to either go to the desktop app or wait for another message to be sent in that channel and hope that it will solve the issue This is very frustrating,0.978358459,0.007134156,0.007245884,0.007261501
45,This app has caused me so much work stress Issues: No phone call notifications on Googles WearOS smart watch * when you get a call and pick it up on desktop it is marked as missed on your phone and leaves a ghost window * the connection quality is so bad compared to dedicated phone calls voice drops in and out comes through laggy * background noise is terrible over voice Definitely worse than a standard work call So bad that people cant understand others and complain about he noise * sometimes calls dont wake my phone at all yet a regular phone call can all the time * the app is slow and bloated feeling just like the desktop version (which is really pretty good tbh) Sure I cant blame this all on slack it is in some ways a hardware and OS issue But theyve set the expectation and they should still know the pain Feature requests: * record calls client side (for privacy) automatically so I can play then back (autodelete after N time unless otherwise specified by the user) ** automatically record calls I was invited to but was not able to answer persons currently in the call should know that such a feature is enabled however * phone call notifications on WearOS * Show your online status of any desktop instance from your phone,0.00292312,0.00287776,0.0029697,0.99122942
46,Ill change this after they either get back to me or fix this Android  my new message notifications wont go away as if I havent seen them and I can no longer view older messages from those same people I also go on a channel and itll say 10+ new messages and theyre not new Ive seen them but the notification keeps sending me way up the channel for no reason No updates to fix these bugs,0.007423042,0.007432155,0.78424391,0.200900893

48,So close This is a great platform for communication but the mobile notifications are appalling They are either nonexistent or are sent after a long period of time This has been brought up by others for a while now and hasnt been delt with It does me and Im sure others no good at all if we cant communicate in a timely fashion With the competition of other similar platforms being so fierce you folks REALLY need to put on your boots and deal with this Fix this and its 5 stars,0.009427997,0.00952902,0.971459135,0.009583848
49,This app has gotten worse over the past few weeks It used to be pretty smooth Now the screen jumps around constantly It notifies way too much every pic upload interrupts what you are doing with a big ugly popup This is not needed It makes the screen jump and pulls you off of text or what you have moved on to The way it saves and uploads pics is so out dated 1 pic a time I have to use my own camera app and transfer yhem over in groups It is a very sloppy app HAVE TO USE FOR WORK,0.00693441,0.348292274,0.637897872,0.006875445
50,I use Slack daily for school and Ive loved it for over a year now But lately (in the last week or two) I will open the app and instantly get signed out of a workspace with the error Invalid Authentication I have to sign back in and then it will happen again in another 5 or 10 mins Its becoming unusable at this point,0.010750027,0.16711508,0.404444146,0.417690746
51,Im so irritated I have sections created to make it easy to find my channels for certain things They are pointless 2 of my sections are duplicated in a long list (but they are not shown together) So seemingly random channels are in one of two different sections that have the same section name This is not so on desktop  just mobile,0.011765497,0.965154974,0.0117475,0.011332029
52,All of a sudden Ive been kicked out of the app for invalid authentification 5 times in the last 15 mins or so Could barely finish typing out a message Have had the app for at least 2 years now and never had a problem before now Hoping this will be resolved soon because it is also affecting my notifications today,0.012577249,0.960569981,0.013311862,0.013540907
53,When this app stops functioning properly (thankfully not too often) I realized how much I depend on it for communicating with my coworkers While theres always room for improvement this is by far the best messaging app out there Ive used Discord G Chat and Teams but none of them compare,0.012655015,0.962417552,0.012461957,0.012465476
54,This app is great in concept I have lots of issues with not getting notifications or getting them inconsistently however this is something I have worked past the current issue is since the most recent update I continue to get logged out randomly while on the app with a invalid authentication error message this is absolutely frustrating while Im responding to urgent work concerns,0.009237106,0.417417514,0.253210925,0.320134454
55,IT IS COMPLETELY UNUSABLE NOW A) Keyboard keeps closing or triggering different UI reactions after a second so its almost impossible to type anything of value B) Any context switch or another UI pops up you lose all your text in the current input box You have to go to the draft window to find them What was Salesforces point for purchasing Slack then killing it with poor enhancements Roll back all your changes The system was working better before Salesforce,0.008612822,0.008578509,0.008501694,0.974306975
56,Used to be great but crashes frequently now and needs to be restarted constantly (latest version of app and Android) Uploads fail notifications are spotty at best and generally more frustrating to use overall This is all on dedicated wifi so definitely the app thats the problem Slack started out great but are slacking in their success  will be happy to change this to 5 star if bugs are addressed,0.007036206,0.007087336,0.978731617,0.007144841
57,Its Slack This should be a 5 star app Know why it isnt You cannot SELECT AND COPY TEXT in messages WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Edit  thanks for the reply I know I can copy the entire message This is frustratingly useless when you want to copy a word or phrase or number from a blob of text Like when you are in the midst of a production/ops problem and are collaborating with other fix agents on a critical issue Guys Please this is really inexcusable,0.008887892,0.612800786,0.008868286,0.369443036
58,App is quite detailed have to put your mind to work when using not real easy to setup the business aspect is well informative however model structure is some what confusioning Good app for a the leaning of a bussiness account to control every direction in which your core people are well informed also keeps management on the progress of the project and each task that is performed,0.692169473,0.011331668,0.011711899,0.284786961
59,Utterly terrible app for 2 critical reasons 1) Single sign on you have multiple accounts to manage for each group dealing with that across devices is very painful 2) notifications fail regularly I waste many hours debugging slack notifications and the issue had persisted across devices,0.011294041,0.010809442,0.011258787,0.96663773

143,Absolutely cannot stand the new full screen multitab interface I opted out of the beta just to get rid of it Now that the update hit Im going to install the previous version Its so annoying  cumbersome Im leaving this review Functionality is still fine as before but I just cant understand who would think these interface changes are an upgrade in any way Wish software companies would stop trying to fix things that arent broken Or at least just make it a setting we can toggle FFS,0.006008318,0.981798324,0.006106197,0.006087161
144,The new update is hot garbage Fire your QA team Half the time the app is not showing me the latest messages in a channel Ill get a notification of a new message but it doesnt show up in the channel unless I force close the app and reopen it This is completely unacceptable for a messaging app and it never happened with the previous version Also it diverges from the desktop apps UI in a way that is inconsistent and frustrating Dont fix what aint broke,0.006457232,0.006473839,0.980707354,0.006361575
145,Used to love this app I use it for work and social Its gone downhill in the last several months with random restarts wrong status (showing people offline when they arent) poor video experience (dropping calls on solid internet speeds etc) messages seemingly randomly not sending freezing on my pixel2 etc Not impressed anymore If there was a better option Id tell my company to use it I keep hoping it gets back to what I originally loved about it (reliable),0.006544583,0.00640831,0.980312081,0.006735026
146,This app has been nothing but a headache since Ive installed it for the sports podcast I am on Instead of the notifications just dropping down it also pushes my active screen slightly back making it difficult to type or pick something I am trying to pick difficult Getting out off snooze mode is difficult if you havent actually figured it out and I dont need that blue notification telling me I have unread messages when Ive read all the messages,0.977313716,0.007604634,0.007474131,0.00760752
147,Update is making every interaction I have miserable Its as if the screen freezes every time I try to tap or text like my touch screen is covered with goo But its not my phone  no problem with other apps Everything takes 10 times longer Editing to clarify the similarity to another reviewerss experience where a tap seems to be interpreted as a tiny swipe  so the screen bounces around when I try to place my text input cursor somewhere else in a text box or when I try to tap Enter,0.007480417,0.007536604,0.007380964,0.977602015
148,First off I extremely dislike the new layout I say that as nicely as possible More importantly the app is just not working well for me New messages are not loading have to close the app and reopen it for them to show up Notifications are missing at times Many times when I click on a notification if I do get it it takes me to the channel but does not have the latest message so I have to close the app and reopen it,0.306944048,0.009413946,0.673918331,0.009723676
149,The app has a lot of potential but is unfortunately ruined for me by a lack of trust and respect for the chosen settings First if I set a DnD then I literally just asked to not be disturbed so please dont give others a oneclick option to override my setting and notify my phone late at night Second please allow me to decide which channels Im in The concept that an app even allows the org owner to make channels mandatory and unleavable again shows a lack of respect for the user I promise I know how I want to use Slack and which channels and notifications are useful to me just let me do it If these issues didnt exist it would be a 5star app but alas it feels pretty bad to not have control of how you use an app,0.260180389,0.391125044,0.004740131,0.343954436
150,Missing notifications on Samsung tab s5e There is no red number signifying unread messages on the icon on my home screen (Like on the app for iphone) I have to go into the app to see if there are any unread messages App icon badges is selected in my app settings The settings for notifications are very limited and I cannot adjust anything there It appears there is the option but nothing happens when I click,0.975756544,0.008110533,0.008144641,0.007988282
151,You may as well use Gchat or any other IM platform It lets you chat with people but imposes tons of arbitrary restrictions that you wont know about until youre trying to send a file or change your notification preferences (which are busted as hell by the way) or find a conversation you had a long time ago The reason for all of this is they want you to buy a premium plan which my employer a small independent business refuses to do Two of the three problems I have are supposedly better if you have premium but it doesnt change the fact that changing notifications preferences is like pulling teeth and you will get tons of notifications by default to the point where youll want to throw your phone/tablet/computer out a window,0.005107057,0.080569155,0.005080409,0.909243379
152,This app is so unreliable Whenever I get messages with preview notification on my phone I cant read them on the app like they were never sent to me How does that even happen Luckily I have the app on my laptop and can see the missing messages there but it is ridiculous how this keeps happening Even when I can clearly see the message on the laptop it does not appear on my phone it just skips to the next one I never had an app with that issue before I would love this app if not for that,0.321350135,0.008791889,0.660945772,0.008912205
153,This is one of those apps that everyone uses only because everyone else uses it It doesnt work very well on Android Calls absolutely do not work on Android Bluetooth headsets do not work on Android Screen sharing doesnt work on Linux dual monitors always shares both your monitors as 1 huge screen (I shouldnt have to apologize for having dual monitors when Im on a call) Im sure all these issues are fixed on Windows (and maybe even Mac) but who cares Those platforms are chock full of apps that work Ppl say lets use slack I hear it works on Linux well it doesnt so lets not  Original Review: (this still counts because of their stupid magic link thing you cant just know your username and password and slack channel name you have to also get email on the platform your trying to login with If you want to login on your phone for example you cant use your desktop email to verify your email address Its so nonintuitive) The most confusing app Ive ever used Spent 15 minutes and still cant login You guys must seriously have meetings about how to make this app difficult to use I use slack on the browser want to use it on the phone this app does not give me that ability,0.002863751,0.002869046,0.002948457,0.991318746
154,Update ruins interface for me It used to be I can open slack and be right where I left off Now I have to swipe to get back to my conversation Ill still use it because I have no choice but honestly it takes more effort to use this interface than the previous one Also why the bottom home dm ECT ribbon Pointless takes up more screen space and I could easily just choose what I want from the list like before It used to be I could bring this up when I wanted Now there is no choice,0.008108902,0.008158118,0.975780518,0.007952461
155,I have been using this for groups who text in Spanish for politics or to help people struggling during the pandemic We connect them with programs  grants that may help them I can only use programs that other people design Its complicated We get 300 names  phones from public records If someone needs an electric bill paid I find the answer that someone has programmed check a box to send the correct information or forms  Ive helped people connect with what they need,0.008992329,0.008973335,0.972620917,0.009413419
156,Recently this app has been very buggy on mobile and OSx Moreso than usual On Android it forces you to sign out of some workspaces unless you click on others first and then circle back and try again Its like some kind of weird cookie and timing problem If I had not been using slack for years I would be very concerned As it is I am accustomed to this nonsense but I still want to call it out in case firsttime users are experiencing this,0.009652972,0.009260464,0.009428431,0.971658133

158,Notifications dont work Randomly either dont show up or flash up momentarily and then vanish Even worse the app sets the message as read so I cant see which channel it came from Multiple times a day I have to manually cycle through all my channels to see what Ive missed Getting notifications on the phone breaks the entire tracking system Amazing Slack cant figure out a problem solved by every other messaging app I use Seems they dont think its their problem,0.2518902,0.007647973,0.007671706,0.732790121
159,Ive had problems getting notifications since our company started using slack Ive dealt with the notification issues This latest design is just not thought through If Im on my phone I want it to function like the rest of my phone This is just a mess UX innovation is great but only when its intuitive,0.009342065,0.971416657,0.009548423,0.009692855
160,The Android app is absolutely useless Push notifications seem to have a mind of their own They almost never come on time and some of them show up minshours after Ive already read the message in app The worst part is that new messages dont show up even when I have the app open and pull down to refresh I open the Mac and see that I have unread messages from hours ago that never showed up in app Im really surprised and dismayed at how terrible Slacks Android app has become,0.733610267,0.007616098,0.007829942,0.250943693
161,this app kinda sucks it will randomly stop making sounds and vibrate only when you get a message then just completely stop sending notifications causing you to miss important messages i checked my phones notification settings and the apps notification settings and all were on yet i still received no notifications had to uninstall and reinstall for it to properly work again i use this for work and if i dont know im being messaged or tagged it can completely screw up my day,0.006692501,0.00677647,0.743182563,0.243348467
162,New app is absolutely horrible The inappropriate use of swipe (now for navigation instead of specific functions) cause you to have to try 345 times to long press anything as it always thinks youre swiping App defaults to channel list instead of most recent conversation Notifications dont work right anymore Blown away that everything was made harder to use instead of easier,0.007425146,0.007743007,0.97759597,0.007235876
163,Just auto updated to newest version It is awful If I didnt have to use it for work Id delete it The ease of use/functionality has been removed in place of something that forces you to navigate between what you want to look at and everything else You had a great UI before why change what didnt need fixing,0.100591967,0.879710918,0.00974653,0.009950585

165,This app is awful It frequently will just give up and never update Ill see there are unread messages in a channel but when I go to the channel theres nothing there Then on another device I can see the messages Or sometimes I will select a channel and Ill just see a blank screen no buttons no text no loading indicator nothing for a solid minute before it updates This has been going on for at least a year I do not believe this app will ever be good I have wifi turned on at home,0.007627723,0.00752013,0.97734005,0.007512097
166,Notifications frequently do not show up I had to set a periodic alarm to check for new posts DMs and chats are listed alphabetically on the home page not chrono If you want to see them chrono you have to tap a different page If you read a message in the app or through the web without tapping the notification on your phone the notification stays One more little thing: when youre done typing the back arrow in the top left does not go back It closes the keyboard first,0.444895605,0.008268735,0.338804108,0.208031552
167,Latest big revision involves swiping between screens and whenever I try to tap something it registers it as a tiny swipe instead of a selection I have to tap super lightly to make sure my finger doesnt contact more than a pinpoint on the screen Did no one use the app before it was released Also messages seem to get lost  I get multiple notifications for incoming messages but can only find one of them when I open the app So frustrating,0.684689884,0.298450445,0.008465762,0.008393909
168,This app has been giving me issues for over a month now I can no long interact on it Ill see a message notification but when I open the app to respond it tells me that my work space is unavailable This is very frustrating and slows down my productivity I hate having to open my laptop just to reply to slack because the app on my phone is a malfunctioning waste of space I would like a solution asap,0.581735976,0.008025037,0.00816694,0.402072048
169,I hate this app Notifications sometimes take forever to get It is super annoying as a workplace tool I have to be subscribed to like 10 channels and get notifications 24 hrs a day I cant keep track of what is going on This needs to be streamlined somehow to make it less busy Maybe have channels people cant reply to or something The whole app could easily be replaced with texting and phone calls Kind of a waste of time,0.479553625,0.299611137,0.008145058,0.21269018
170,Was good Then suddenly updated and boom: all my productivity goes out the window with a new design that is much less intuitive and less efficient than before Poor design decisions abound throughout and constant swiping is now required Hate it when companies decide that they can just change the product I paid for after the fact ,0.010824728,0.968144343,0.010666526,0.010364403
171,The app is a little awkward If I start a conversation in the desktop version the last few messages in the convo are not always shown in the app That makes it difficult to switch from the desktop to the app if I need to continue my convo on my phone That may be a problem with my wifi connection but I havent seen a way to refresh where it will sych with the desktop chat history,0.604176438,0.008812194,0.008768798,0.37824257
172,The consistent issues with this app for the past 34 months has been pretty bad Examples: my drafts dont work I cant edit a draft message when I click the text field it takes me to a new message My groups I organize my messages in doesnt save on the app from when I make edits on the desktop Ive had to reinstall the app 4 times because it lasts for days without updating Proper notifications dont come through and I dont see messages HUNDREDS of times over the past few months,0.006045645,0.006273619,0.52868084,0.458999896
173,Its a big hassle to navigate the layout especially in opening various chats Im part of Nonintuitive layout/navigation Also not sure if this has online storage (which I would really like to avoid using all my phone storage) Additionally if you have a Slack account with any given email and you delete that Slack account you can create a new Slack account with the same email right,0.007152057,0.374355339,0.007356976,0.611135628
174,I would have had a five star rating before the most recent update I did not update for about 3 months but I decided to update about a week ago and have been having such a bad experience I think there might be some sort of memory leak because about 30 seconds into having the app open things start to slow down exponentially to the point that you have to wait 30 seconds from when you actually tap on the text input field before the keyboard shows up and you can start typing Unusable,0.006525625,0.006365827,0.366384349,0.620724199
175,This design SUCKS I dont want the main panel to be a long list of TEXT names of channels and people This does not facilitate quickly navigating conversations I also need to be able to quickly switch between conversations without going back to this HORRENDOUS main page of TEXT names Unbelievable I can see this being the start of Slacks decline all because some idiot had the idea to fix a brilliant design that was never broke Not ok the app constantly freezes and crashes my phone now,0.006054312,0.006087302,0.981757409,0.006100977
176,Idk what happened but the last update made the app lag crash and delay notifications by hours Sometimes I cant even type or read a message it lags so bad Before the update 5 stars But until it gets fixed 1 for sure Its that unusable Ive resorted to going to the web app on my phone Yikes,0.010293905,0.969073613,0.010395664,0.010236817
177,You KNOW your new UI is bad when you have to include a tutorial that explains how to use it to someone whos been using your app for years I happen to think the new design is also ugly but thats just my opinion Usability is undeniably worse so its no surprise to see that other recent reviews seem to reflect that And after trying to use it for a day Im also already noticing the slowness and endless loading screens that other users are reporting I thought Slack had better QA than this,0.007240057,0.007415808,0.9777318,0.007612335
178,Since the update it SUCKS Like the others swipe to move between conversations It was there before the update now its the only option Come on think before removing things because you think it might be better I cant even downgrade to the better interface because it doesnt have an option to remove updates Smooth move folks,0.012140558,0.012148437,0.96397443,0.011736575
179,This was a good app but all of a sudden there is a major issue with it and my S8+ It doesnt ever notify me when I have been pinged I have to open the app and see if anyone has reached out to me which isnt ok if Im away This is definitely some kind of update issue as everything else has been checked on including Slack tech support Whatever you guys did fix it,0.009652846,0.009806622,0.010290468,0.970250063

181,This app worked great until I updated it today 4/24/20 It wouldnt let me in the app at all (animated logo with no end in sight) until I pressed on the app icon and went to jump to and typed in my channel that is the only way to access it my workspace is all messed up no channels that Im a part of listed it keeps saying offline and so I hit the refresh type of button and it goes away but not for long this app is totally messed up now 1 star Update: works as expected now5 stars,0.763618603,0.005783085,0.224658084,0.005940228
182,I am greatly disappointed with the new mobile apps navigation After the recent updates to the desktop I had high hopes for a great new mobile app Having to swipe contently to get around is quite about for me I am sure there are many who will love the new design I just wish slack had a option to pick between the two interfaces,0.01007442,0.010236691,0.970054834,0.009634055
183,Latest update cluttered the UI significantly and made it difficult to use The latest update also broke message sending My messages now fail to send each time no matter how many times I tap them to attempt to resend I tried submitting a feedback message and it also failed to send Previous versions of the app were fantastic  hopefully these issues are resolved soon,0.258806541,0.317747345,0.41519261,0.008253504
184,Lately when I see a highlighted channel and tap it sometimes it doesnt show the new message in the app even though there is one The channel remains highlighted and theres nothing I can do to refresh it to get it to show the message Very inconvenient for a product my job uses I just have to get on a computer or wait until the app decides to show the message Force closing the app as restarting it doesnt work either Please fix it ,0.483944047,0.00873935,0.498518921,0.008797681
185,Works great But the new version took away the ability to mute for 1 24 hours etc Now you can only turn then on or off If I dont want to be botherd with a channel I have to remember to turn it back on Please bring back the other options again I hope it still mutes my PC when I mute the phone Have not checked that yet,0.010395176,0.010580863,0.968706972,0.01031699
186,[Update 5/26/20: Problem appears to be fixed Thanks Slack] Navigation look feel and basic usage all are fine Biggest issue for me is that the latest update made uploading photos take so long For some reason on my Pixel 2 XL when I go to select a photo it takes a ridiculously long time to show the photos in the upload gallery Not sure if this is a common issue,0.007214873,0.325342676,0.007530725,0.659911726

198,Only one issue but big usability goof Starred channels with unread messages show up in same list with unstarred with unreads The whole point of starring channels is to see important unread messages amongst the flood of stuff you usually dont care about The mobile app kills that feature that is present in desktop app Big drop on the part of slack Otherwise great stable front end for slack,0.485495708,0.230771443,0.275525669,0.00820718
199,The app is completely unreliable sending notifications I only see messages came in when I look for them For a tool used in business getting critical messages hours after theyre sent is useless Likewise randomly checking the app often enough to get them is a waste of time I dont have Pretty embarrassing for the company who thinks theyll be the end of email,0.975552811,0.008127159,0.008125588,0.008194442
200,I have been using slack for a couple of months and it has worked fine The only problem is that I dont get notified when I get a new message and I turn the notifications ON and all the settings are right but it does not work The same happens to my team I send messages and they dont get the notification So you have to be constantly checking to see if you have any messages and that is very annoying My team and I have missed meetings because we never received a notification PLEASE FIX,0.007853801,0.007654816,0.976765927,0.007725456
201,The most difficulty messaging app ever In this day and age it should be stupid simple to message between coworkers this is not its easy just to use our phone messaging service that guess what  we are already paying for so why pay for another keep it Its worthless,0.013255242,0.466577017,0.012993707,0.507174035
202,Doesnt load new messages/update when new messages are posted It will notify you of new message and when you click on the notification it takes you to the channel but none of the new messages are loaded Only fix is to completely exit the app and relaunch every new channel post Horrible Also if you go from 4g to wifi any messages during network change never come through So you miss important messages and look like the class idiot for not knowing details that the rest of the team know,0.006059692,0.006152293,0.981869809,0.005918207
203,The new update is really buggy I get notifications for new messages but when I click on the notification it goes to the channel but doesnt show the message Non of the new messages are showing up and the bold indicator of the channel wont go away Very annoying since I dont have access to my laptop right now,0.009554216,0.009357337,0.97184816,0.009240288
204,Unreliable Ive been playing with the notification settings for two weeks Ive tried every configuration I still do not get notification for some message and Ill get them for other cant stand this app I will be pushing to stop using it at work until the notification system is more reliable,0.530480407,0.014979848,0.015255107,0.439284638
205,Since the new update (March 18) Im regularly having the same problem that Pratik Shetty mentioned below in the reviews  Im using a mobile version on Samsung Galaxy Tab A and the back and home buttons for the Tablet screen overlay Slacks new message field As a result I try to type a new message and the app collapses  Frustrating to say the least given that my tablet is the main way I use Slack,0.006964843,0.007047465,0.978903436,0.007084256
206,Unfortunately it just feels like theyre trying so hard to make it userfriendly that it takes all power out of the users hands I feel like I cant do anything Trying to connect multiple accounts between my computer and phone is an awful process The magic links that get sent to my email dont sign me in automatically I cant tell which accounts are connected to which email and there is no easy way to find that out Customizing servers as an admin is impossible Used the app for 4 years,0.006357493,0.132519714,0.006289482,0.854833312
207,Dont rely on the apps notifications for anything important I got an 8:55 slack message about my 9:00 meeting being in a different place and the notification came through at 9:45 after the meeting was already over Often I dont get any notifications for messages at all,0.013119412,0.013693846,0.960229933,0.012956809
208,I use the app constantly and find it adequate for most messaging tasks However it has a few fundamental problems that make it difficult to use as constantly as I need it First it stores an inordinate amount of data (Im at 1gb currently) second the user search functionally is pretty bad it doesnt match complete input so even when typing a full username I still must scroll to find a recipient (my org has 200k users) third it fails to properly upload shared files most times,0.007225614,0.45646642,0.007314052,0.528993914
209,The app suddenly started crashing and not responding A LOT Chews through battery And a feature they used to have has been gone for a while: auto clearing Android notifications once you view a message on desktop All in all an app that started out AMAZING two or so years ago has gotten worse to the point of me literally being unable to use it due to the app being unresponsive and crashing,0.975045804,0.008156588,0.008317733,0.008479876
210,Yikes there are some serious issues here Ill have notifications of new messages but they wont actually show up When I do see the new messages they dont get marked as read These are the bare minimum requirements of a messaging app (I wouldnt even call them features) and theyre busted These issues have been present for months,0.010890755,0.967229663,0.01099601,0.010883572
211,If you are sending a one time login link via email you need to take into account that most good businesses will prescan all incoming URLs which means your one Time link wont work when its actually received How is this not taken into account for a business app Also had bad problems with sending images If image upload fails then you cant just cancel and resend was not working Had to uninstall app to clear the stuck resend which is pinned to the bottom and doesnt scroll away Fix it,0.434226488,0.006469725,0.00650458,0.552799206
212,I was on vacation Aug 716 and was only viewing slacks (not responding) Now that Im back to work Im experiencing the same issue everyone else is noting I cannot type because my slack lags and takes a long time to actually show what I typed My email and texts and even this review is not experiencing the same issue This is having a huge impact on my productivity and Id imagine others as well Can there be a rollback to the previous version which wasnt experiencing this issue,0.008212809,0.008186608,0.008174856,0.975425727
213,Works at a basic level but is buggy compared to iOS and Windows versions of the app Sensitivity for sliding left and right between levels of conversation is inconsistent (not sensitive enough) which funnily enough is the opposite issue from the last update Notifications will occasionally fail to come through and indications that someone else is typing sometimes dont show when they should or show when they shouldnt Could be better and is lacking compared to other messaging apps,0.008998794,0.009220398,0.742862455,0.238918352
214,Ive used Slack for a little over a year and Ive enjoyed it But this newest update has killed it the new interface is terrible and forced swiping isnt that great Now its hard to click to comment or emoji because the app thinks Im trying to swipe I have to long press in order to do anything which gets clunky after a while,0.008527108,0.97425541,0.00857741,0.008640072
215,Since the latest update major features no longer work I constantly have to uninstall and reinstall the app to get some features to function It is difficult to reply to messages because my home screen buttons cover the message box The 3 dot menu doesnt function at all so I cannot set my status or change my preferences Sometimes I cannot even select a channel to talk in It is the only app that I have trouble with on my tablet,0.225976598,0.007841876,0.641356481,0.124825045
216,I dont know how you could roll out a new UI with so many bugs and issues I can barely use my phone app right now and I cant trust it to get or send messages in real time Its not like Im doing complicated things on Slack These things are the basic backbone of the system: sending and receiving messages It sucks to log in on the desktop and see that my phone app just wasnt loading new threads Fix the Android App,0.006289991,0.006372996,0.472748014,0.514588999
217,Edit: 2 months later and still having same issue listed below Also scrolling through messages to find older messages is cumbersome Sometimes the app forces me bach to most recent messages so I have to scroll back to older messages again Good app Only thing is that sometimes after sending a message a blank space shows up but the text doesnt appear unless I tap it,0.975415608,0.008152852,0.008239524,0.008192016
218,Lately a few bugs I am trying to see if my version is updated I use this for work and its vital that I can communicate through it Lately I have noticed that in one of my dms with the manager and supervisor even when they use my name same way as always I am not being notified of the new message It was not a good situation It is happening intermittently with this one group dm,0.011134276,0.191601619,0.786393424,0.010870681
219,Im a long time slack user and have generally been delighted by it However this version is completely unreliable and barely usable It has hard crashed my phone twice in the last day and Im not doing anything out of the ordinary There are some severe mobile usability issues that need to be addressed,0.011076368,0.010987785,0.011168836,0.966767011
220,Im not even receiving any of the messages or notifications for anything anymore And I have not done anything different with my phone since I started using it I will be lucky if I get any order notifications currently And its so laggy from when I receive an order notification from when I actually get the order can be from instant to 10 minutes later,0.167728823,0.011558365,0.011712879,0.808999933
221,I updated the app a couple of days ago It worked fine before Now the emoji that are responses to messages randomly disappear and reappear The emoji picker is slow to load partially blocked and difficult to close (as a double backspace no longer works) I regret updating Edit: Almost a month later these problems have not been fixed,0.972422515,0.009067745,0.009278064,0.009231675
222,I guess it works but it feels clunky Lack of ability to view shared screens is a major mark against considering the competition (and webcams even work now so its not like video isnt something that cant be done in this very app) Nor is there an ability to synchronise an app connection with a desktop connection (for the screen sharing) so I end up appearing twice on calls Also a recent update took away the option to switch audio sources on calls so to use my bluetooth headset I need to turn it off and turn it back on again FOR EVERY CALL That pushes the experience down to unpleasant,0.005537645,0.126277668,0.862713041,0.005471646
223,I get the people running the app need money to keep it running but limiting messages to only be seen for a month no group calls/video calls (and then even limiting the number of people who can join in the 699 monthly plan) and limiting what permissions people can have/get/give was not it chief You can do all this and MORE with Discord If youre a company I suggest using something else unless you want to give 1299$ a month for these things that are free on Discord,0.008373862,0.008542734,0.974667737,0.008415666
224,Dont like the fact it force downloads media notifications into my storage You can delete them but theyre always back the next day UPDATE = got contacted by the slack team who said they would look into seeing why they download never heard backand after opening my music player today I was greeted with 30 more unwanted notifications Uninstalled because I literally cant take it anymore,0.008640207,0.442690518,0.008498274,0.540171
225,I really like slack however I have a Samsung se 10 (I think) and recently the app has been freezing hard core or the screen stutter/shakes I figured this would be the best way to alert the developers It used to work fine and in a timely manner but now its almost unusable I constantly have to switch to my iPad or computer to use which is fine when Im home but inconvenient when Im not I see theres a long line of Samsung users here experiencing this issue too Plz fix,0.006469269,0.006373936,0.006422171,0.980734624
226,Whatever was in the update on Oct 23 it has caused massive problems The app consistently freezes Sometimes everything goes blank and sometimes you can see your last channel and the chat but everything is still locked Cant even scroll up and down in the chat channel you can see Android device most recent OS using Samsung Tab A 2020 model 11/9/2020 I should have noted that the only solution ended up requiring a complete uninstall and new installation Ive done that 3x,0.007332101,0.007198125,0.978021994,0.00744778
227,Update 6/2021 Now with firewall allowing slack I still cant pull channels What is being used besides Google play services Something is being blocked 7/2000 No offline use is ridiculous No notifications of messages found out they break it on purpose until you update to newest app Annoying way to force an update Yes miss critical business messages and look clueless Thanks Still same issue when theres an update to install they break notifications so you are forced to install,0.006334135,0.980743401,0.006479039,0.006443425
228,Mobile Push Notifications are Hit or Miss I have used this app for years but the main problem is inconsistencies with push notifications Ive had channels have notifications that did not alert me that had responses minutes after I switched to another app and were still not alerting me 30 minutes later Also if you have your desktop app/page for slack open it also affects your mobile notifications sometimes either very late or not at all Really bad because 99% use this for business,0.006808417,0.196431727,0.006687472,0.790072383
229,LatelyThe app has been Horrible Sometimes the notifications come in sometimes they dont When you check the new messages the app doesnt update You have to close the app and reopen it to see those new messages Update: thank you for responding Feel free to update your comment once the bug has been fixed,0.010106884,0.010505155,0.969298499,0.010089463
230,Removed a star Issue below might be fixed but since notifications rarely work it is hard to tell Mobile app suffers from an updating issue Often will receive a notification that a new message has arrived but clicking on the notification will bring up the appropriate channel without the new message(s) Is necessary to actually close the app and reopen to get the message(s) to show Have heard same complaint from other users Difficult to find inapp feedback option is pretty much useless,0.980292276,0.006555174,0.006609876,0.006542674
231,Normally I think slack is a great app but in the last 24 hours it has become completely unusable for any extended period of time If I kill it and start fresh I can get maybe a message out before it completely slows down and becomes unresponsive Sometimes channel rendering and navigation just freeze at a loading view and other times the keyboard becomes borderline impossible to use Very frustrating,0.008488764,0.008348202,0.974676622,0.008486412
232,Latest update totally sucks The new UI is plain awful Cant you idiots just leave well enough alone Stop messing with everything trying to optimize my experience Slack used to be so much nicer than its competitors because it kept things simple and easy to use Now its starting to feel like the Facebook app where doing anything takes 10 clicks and I have to search around endlessly for simple things like chat I bet theres some fool VP who thinks Feeds are magical and that your magical AI systems know more about what I want than I do You suck at your jobs,0.006245421,0.980938722,0.006510502,0.006305356
233,The app has become nearly unusable in the past couple weeks If I open the app from a notification itll freeze before it even loads the messages If I manage to get messages to load the app will become unresponsive as I scroll through a channel especially if new messages are coming into the channel (Using Google Pixel 4),0.009460787,0.009225619,0.971838614,0.009474981
234,I consistently see notifications for messages that when I click through dont show in app The notification engine serves more up to date data then than the app Really not productivity evening App is enerally clunky with communicating and runs slow (might be because Im on a pixel 1) App really just ok for reading messages and I have to rely on notifications to read those since they wont show in the app even when Im on wifi Love slack overall really dont like this app,0.006656445,0.248442776,0.525530851,0.219369928
235,Sucks so bad I came to Googs Play to post this Slow AF I post several comments / images at a time because it seems it freezes but its actually working There is no notification thatthe app is indded working Serious lag Of course I have to suffer through this because Slack is the interrupter of choice Stop the bloat and speed it up Slackers,0.199755898,0.011301895,0.777457922,0.011484285
236,Edited This is now fixed I think it was a change on the windows app maybe but this just started working correctly The team also put specific content on Android settings that also helped but i am now getting notifications and my dev team likes me (a bit) more Old review: Need help with Oreo and Notifications I dont think your Android app team gets how to keep the app sending notifications in Oreo given features to reduce battery consumption My dev team hates that I dont get their notifications if I am not at my desk but Slack seems to always be shut down on my Oneplus 3T on Oreo I have tried every setting I can find online to keep Slack awake but it never seems to fix the issue I really need this resolved as it is hurting productivity when my team is blocked on approvals or requirements from me,0.004335789,0.004526288,0.004419628,0.986718295
237,near as I can tell the only reason to use this app is Im on mobile and the people Im working with dont want to use Discord I like all my friends that insist on using this service a little less for making me use this its broken you cant even upload your own animated gifs and have them be animated I am taking on faith that its more useful on desktop,0.008826675,0.413335183,0.008832665,0.569005477
238,Near completely stagnant development for over a year possible more than two and the first major change is just ugly genetic looking new logo for the sake of change and giving lots of money to some random design firm All companies I work with switched to other options already except one that uses free Edit: Other phone accidentally got updated to the new logo version New UI color scheme looks like they picked random colors as some dont work like dark grey on dark purple,0.005365764,0.983773265,0.005468997,0.005391973
239,I used to have little to no problems with slack but now Im missing messages most of my chats wont load and I cant search key words Its not my connection its the app I dont know what happened but this has made my job incredibly difficult I know some of the crew members I work with have a lot of the same issues Please fix your app its not a game I can just delete Its required for me to do my job and Im getting in trouble because of these bugs,0.006961495,0.978899651,0.007136249,0.007002605
240,So frustrating Theres no way to set your status or availability from the Android app The only thing you can do is go in and out of DND You cant set a status icon or status message Even worse Slacks own help pages give directions that dont match the app It tells you to tap the threedot button and then tap Set Status There is no Set Status option in that menu Was it removed,0.977433816,0.007481894,0.007558341,0.00752595
241,Slack continues to create bizarre design decisions that reduce usability Recent change makes clicking a slack workspace image now do the same thing as clicking the 3 dots instead of it going to the workspace If I wanted to click the 3 dots Id click that Dont make the far left target do the same thing as the right one Horrible UX,0.976457967,0.007808318,0.007949654,0.007784061
242,There is an issue when I open the app Sometimes I only see a white page with the big logo in the middle and get stuck at there without entering the app Its been persistent for a few days Please double check with the dev team This is pretty annoying My phone is Gal note 10 plus and the app is up to date,0.010609148,0.365582043,0.010792051,0.613016758
243,Blah what a nuisance SLACK can be and I have to use this app for work Its great for keeping communications for specific projects together and being highly searchable (which it should be since SLACK means Searchable Log of All Conversations and Knowledge) but the notifications can (at times) be as annoying a Reply All email conversation (which isnt entirely SLACKs fault) Also maybe its my companies security policy but SLACK will sign me out randomly and signing back in is a hassle,0.007748194,0.007888993,0.363841027,0.620521786

248,this new update has made it so I no longer get easy access to the notifications messages on my lock screen are still visible but when I touch them to go directly to the message it doesnt do that and just puts them on read so when I have to go into the app to find the full message I dont even know what channel it came from because those are no longer emboldened either reactionary emojis arent visible anymore either Ive never had this issue with this before until the update,0.008464481,0.227416649,0.755410862,0.008708008

253,The app doesnt recognize when you read messages so I always have tons of red notifications until I go to my desktop and reread them there Its frustrating because I keep thinking I have new messages and dont Also the push notifications do not work even though I enabled them on mobile and through the desktop app Seems like slack is either slacking on mobile totally or focusing on iOS,0.00966568,0.009511834,0.971499413,0.009323073

255,Terrible app so many problems Example  when I go to reply the android navigation buttons are over the text box in portrait mode so clicking in that box just closes the app I was able to work around this by switching to landscape mode but then you cant see what youre writing or the message thread Now also if your phone switches back to portrait in the middle of writing you lose the whole message you just wrote Basically unusable on Android,0.007379973,0.199092843,0.007007449,0.786519735

266,If you only have a single workspace its kind of ok but the number of presses to switch workspaces is painful Even just allowing the back action to go to the Workspace Selector would be better than having the back action exit the application Separately attaching an image to a message seems to crash Slack constantly Most of the time the pictures dont even load in the selector much less upload to the channel,0.973499501,0.008687582,0.008957008,0.008855909

707,Its okay The app definitely requires a strong steady network connection otherwise youre bound to see a dreaded Connecting message permanently It seems very picky about the stability of its connection which is kind of a bummer for teams deployed on the field trying to get i touch with the office Its image upload is very lacking in that aspect It will upload pictures in full resolution which arguably is a good thing for graphic designers but a terrible thing when trying to show a quick snap of something The photo sharing feature of any other messaging app (which resizes and compress the image) is far more suited Its just impossible to upload full resolution pictures on flaky connections,0.00584513,0.005653382,0.9826142,0.005887288

717,I truly love Slack but this week Ive been cut off saying its no longer supported by my phones OS Rather than simply preventing it from loading/working cant we just still use it albeit with possibly reduced untested features I cant afford hundreds of dollars for a new phone just to run Slack which I only use for work Now I cannot communicate with my team This is a very poor user experience I understand you cant support everything forever but the app is still giving me notifications so its still working on there to some capacity I just cant get the chat screens or interact at all Not everyone can afford a new phone every 2 years,0.00519336,0.005212504,0.984131674,0.005462462

723,They disabled support for Android vesions below 80 If you just count 71 70 and 60 thats still 10% of Android users that can no longer use this app from one day to the next What are we supposed to do Toss out our otherwise perfectly working phones and contribute to the global ewaste problem just so we can keep using Slack Same with their browser support Is your browser a bit out of date Sorry our website no longer works Why No reason we just dont like that number next to version in your browser And no Slack Ill say it before your bot bothers to respond: offering me a link to the minimum requirements in no way shape or form addresses anything I wrote,0.004766716,0.004821225,0.004882676,0.985529383

730,Until recently this app has worked very well on my phone However now it is not letting me switch between my workspaces as it used to Instead when I try to switch between them by clicking on the workspace icons it demands I sign out of the space I want to enter Ive tried restarting my phone Ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app Ive cleared my phones cache Please fix this issue pronto The app used to work so seamlessly This new problem is very disappointing,0.393930031,0.006440285,0.00649886,0.593130824
731,It gets the job done but its interface is not so friendly You kinda need training before using the app For me it was easy for my colleagues it was messy and they always miss any updates I add There can be an easier way to find messages around and channels Plusthere should be away for the group owner/admin to force notifications for colleagues when needed I dunno just suggesting Thanks anyway :),0.008447788,0.008766977,0.974414965,0.00837027
732,Im getting my messages delayed quite oftensometimes the previous messages dont show up but the latest messages show up After I close the application and reopen Ill get the messages properly Sometimes I do cache clear to fix  but its annoying to do often Also when I check a new message the notification wont clear indicating that its read I use Slack both on phone and laptop At first I thought this might be due to network issues but its not the case,0.007345745,0.395527576,0.589875816,0.007250863

737,Id say Ive had a great and seamless experience with the app 9/10 times However sometimes the app notifies me about a new message I may have got about 30 minutes late Sometimes even after I set my availability to Online it doesnt reflect that and Ive had others complain to me about why I was away for 2 hours (because I didnt realise I was still being shown away) Like I said Ive mostly had a great experience but maybe iron out a few bugs and youd deserve a 6 star rating :),0.006858264,0.007005665,0.007073073,0.979062998

739,Good experience Would be nice to have Mark as read in the notification panel instead of me having to open the app or switch between multiple workspaces And the new interface isnt visible on all workspaces Its weird to have two different interfaces at the same time Update: Thanks for replying I went into each of my workspaces closed app and opened again Now its working fine But that certainly should have happened automatically Have updated the rating,0.006830834,0.006826326,0.979156706,0.007186134
740,The app itself is great but this might be the worst notifications on an android messenging app Ive ever seen The notifications dont stack by channel dont have any noticeable difference between normal messages and ones with any kind of theres always only one notification on the notification bar regardless of how many unread messages from one or more channels I could go on forever nowadays its just unacceptable to have something like this on the market,0.975539017,0.008248155,0.008143189,0.008069639
741,It works often and other times the notifications are a total pain and either dont appear or appear a day later Today I saw 7 notifications on my laptop that didnt appear in my phone from yesterday This happens randomly and seems to be the same for many people and is a fundamental failure of a messaging app There seems to be a similar issue with calls which sometimes wont work Apart from that the app is OK but doesnt really flow It doesnt show additional workspaces Not sure if this is just my app or that I need to manually configure additional signins but would have thought that it would mirror my laptop There are probably a lot of improvements that could be made but the basics really need to be sorted out,0.005037758,0.004937185,0.005079581,0.984945476
742,For the last couple of days it stops working properly  I cant see the list of my channels or contacts  its all blank However if I click on the empty line the channel or conversation opens and I can see the messages but its like walking blind in the dark forest  you never know which tree you hit or how to find the one you need And its so frustrating as theres a lot happening at my workspace at the moment and I have to struggle with such a trivial thing like app fail,0.975944192,0.008028327,0.008048114,0.007979366
743,It is one of the worst Android apps that I have used On laptop it works flawlessly On mobile it just shows notifications on clicking the notification it takes forever to load and doesnt even display the full message many times Even if you reply to a text it says couldnt be able to send it please retry So if Slack doesnt mean to enhance their mobile app then just discontinue the app please,0.646282477,0.007595327,0.007838978,0.338283218
744,Since the last update there is a serious problem with constructing messages as you cannot easily move around the text field to correct typos or edit what you have written Like another reviewer mentioned its feels like there is a problem with the screen recognising a tap but it is fine on my other apps Workaround is to long press as if you are highlighting a word but this is really time consuming Borderline unusable unless writing short simple replies Im on a Samsung Galaxy S9,0.007413303,0.977769213,0.007372566,0.007444918
745,Usefull corporate app and a standard in the industry Though I hate that the app is not androidoriented We android users use the back button a lot but in Slack it takes us out of the application instead of the previous screen within Slack Extremely annoying The back button is rendered USELESS BAD UX DESIGN there Every channel should be accessible more easily and behave more like a common messaging app like whatsapp I hate having to press the logo button to get the list of channels then if I want to get back to the list I cant use the back button REALLY BAD UX DESIGN for a productivity app Its really designed for iOS users,0.897333049,0.093140692,0.004769714,0.004756544
746,When slack works it is great for IM both for work and private I use it everyday However it is awkward to deal with anything else like files and search I am having issues with the app on my phone not receiving notifications at all or too late channels stop updating and bad performance The support unfortunately have only confirmed that these are indeed bugs and there is no fix as of yet,0.009055041,0.270574656,0.009155722,0.711214581
747,Ever since the last update the app becomes unresponsive It lags when you type Ive never had to close and then restart the app as much as I have to do now Ive been using it basically since the beginning on different mobile devices always worked really well until now If I didnt use Slack so much I would uninstall the app completely Extremely frustrating Please fix ASAP Update  everything is working again as expected after the last update Thanks for the fix,0.007737838,0.008052586,0.542816163,0.441393413

757,New interface is horrible It used to be that you could seamlessly swap between laptop and phone and comfortably use a familiar interface While Im open to relearning an interface like how FB has revamped theirs on multiple occasions the deal breaker for me here is the simple fact that I cant even see messages I get notifications for on my phone I get notified then when I load the app and chat it doesnt show the new messages Which means I have to boot up my laptop to reply Ridiculous,0.007690122,0.327714918,0.656780847,0.007814113

760,Worst business app ever When I receive a call on a multiple devices and answer from one of them the other devices should stop ringing Inst was they keep ringing for almost a minute so that it is impossible to talk with the person on the other side Also it doesnt synchronise immediately if you read one message in one device you still get the notification in the others Rubbish,0.169432085,0.01168094,0.011811301,0.807075674
761,The mobile and desktop apps are both very glitchy The worst part of the mobile app is that I frequently get red notifications that my messages didnt send properly and I need to click to resend them Except they did send And I have no way of removing the errors other than to resend the same messages They just collect at the bottom of the conversation window I wish we would just go back to using skype,0.97409819,0.008813493,0.008414584,0.008673733
762,I am using both the desktop version and the phone version What is frustrating is that the slack on my phone refreshes recent notification so late I need to close and open it again to see the new messages on the different channels and it is so time consuming and it causes delay to give updates to those messages Another thing is notifications on my slack phone are showing not real time I hope this will be fixed asap for it is so stressful to us users of this platform Thank you,0.388446451,0.006908624,0.319002736,0.285642189

764,This app would be great if it wasnt for the dreadful issue with notifications I have been using this app for over 3 years at this point And everything about the app itself is nice and featurefull It has message channels a desktop version file sharing formatting search history a nice interface etc However when you send a message you can pretty much guarantee it will not be seen any time soon The actual message is sent but nobody will notice until they open the app themselves manually There have been too many times when important messages have been missed and time has been wasted Due to this we have had to resort to standard text messages for any critical or important messages I have been holding out hope that this issue will one day be fixed but at this point Ive given up This has been a problem since at least December 2018 but from what I can tell from searching the internet this goes back to 2016 We have followed all instructions given by Slack about battery optimisation settings etc but these have made no difference This is the only messaging app that has any issues with push notifications so I feel this must be an issue with the app itself Until Slack do something to fix these issues I advise users to be aware,0.003454864,0.362720428,0.003420806,0.630403902

766,I use Slack on my desktop (browser) and the mobile app and its very frustrating that notifications arent in sync anymore My phone still shows notifications that I read hours ago in the browser I know that this affects our entire team (not sure about iOS) Please fix this this used to work in the past I had mixed feelings about the new UI but Im actually fine with it now (Though not sure if its a good idea to have a nonstandard navigation for the average user),0.006417143,0.006521486,0.52478309,0.46227828

768,I really dont like the new UI and im a developer so im open minded Swipping often doesnt work as intended there are drafts that are not drafts i cant delete them and they always show as unseen Trying to move the cursor in RTE is swiping the screen its really painfull There is not enough contrast much harder to follow the text too much white in the day theme For me a big step back 2 stars untill the issues are fixed at least,0.008672446,0.620986255,0.008768957,0.361572342
769,The mobile and desktop apps really need to be streamlined Mobile notifications for messages I already read on desktop dont get cleared so I end up having to read through and clear the redundant notifications on my phone Not exactly a good use of time I like Slack but with the shift to work from home I get more messages and notifications than ever and this is getting really annoying,0.008004464,0.976159316,0.007929556,0.007906664

771,VERY buggy experience Clicking on a channel takes me to another channel often Notifications sometimes doesnt work sometimes it sends a high prio push for every single message Loading images is always megaslow Calling is unusable (zoom hangouts etc works fine) keeps ringing even though you picked up takes ages to connect huge delays Cant believe this is a paid product by a company worth 23 billion USD,0.007451065,0.007225683,0.97794904,0.007374212

773,Its not bad but few features can be improved for example you try to send a message in a thread and decide not to later this will be shown like draft at the top It stays there forever and I dont know how to get rid of the draft state You should atleast have a way to clear drafts and then proceed I found another one that is supporting reactions in threads which I would like to use it quite a lot There are certain minor changes needed  may be your test suite needs improvement,0.007114119,0.243971983,0.006937117,0.741976781
774,The concept is good but execution is poor Standard chatting features such as replying to comments are missing This is unacceptable for an app in 2020 especially one that wants to be used for collaboration The channel feature is neat but discord does a better job by having servers and different channels within them that are further broken by text and voice channels Slack does some things right but fails in a lot more Hopefully they are working to catch up on a lot of these features in 2020,0.412052744,0.006245533,0.575623481,0.006078242

777,About software the desktop app is great if you dont mind compromising huge amount of ram for just a messaging app The phone app is slow needs constant internet to work sending images is a pain I wouldnt recommend slack if you want to increase productivity in your company It is not a project manager tool Slack is not customizable and all its integrations are just half way developed,0.457799484,0.007296666,0.527461436,0.007442413
778,The latest call screen UI update is completely sick  the most used buttons (loudspeaker on/off and mic mute) have been hidden into menus or just started to hide in idle Shall I explain that on every single call now I have to make a series of taps  slides and now I cant see whether Im muted or not when it hides the mic button This also involves an extra delay to unmute Please hire a UX expert and do some tests before doing UI decisions,0.497712903,0.48333221,0.009655733,0.009299153
